Instructions for Restrict Quantity:

1) Copy the code example into a new web page e.g. mals.html
2) Download and save the mals-scripts.js file into the same folder (note: can be in another)
3) Change the product information in the form to your product using productpr

    <select name="productpr" mals-qty="1..3,4..6,7+">
        <option value="Small:0">Small</option>
        <option value="Medium:5.00">Medium (+$5)</option>
        <option value="Large:7.00">Large (+$7)</option>
    </select>

    TIP!
    - Include the product name in both value and text of option to make it clear to customer in cart too
    - For more information about productpr see https://www.mals-e.com/tpv.php?tp=2

4) Add the quantity options

    in the productpr select add an attribute mals-qty. For example

    mals-qty="1..3,4..6,7+"

    .. = to
    i.e. 1 to 3 items, 4 to 6 items

    i) You can add as many options as you want separated by a comma.
    ii) For the last option use + symbol e.g. 7+ = seven and more items

5) Ensure your wwX and userid are the same as Mals (TIP! enter your details at the top before copying example)
6) Open the web page in a browser e.g. Chrome and test it

--- Calling Script ---
The script is very versatile. You can activate it on one or more forms (or links) easily. Note: if you don't know jQuery selectors visit https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_selectors.asp

- Example 1 = specific form by id
MalsScripts.restrictQty('#form1');

This will activate the script on the form with id="form1"
    
- Example 2 = not enough quantity callback function
MalsScripts.restrictQty('#form1',function(){
    // Called when not enough qty
    
});

- Example 3 = callback function when form submitted
MalsScripts.restrictQty('#form1',function(){
    // Called when form submitted
    
});

--- General Notes ---
- Add class .mals-ignore to any forms you don't want transformed e.g. <form action="http://wwX.aitsafe.com/cf/add.cfm" class="mals-ignore">...
- You can select multiple forms by using a comma e.g. MalsScripts.restrictQty('#form1,#form2');
- jQuery selectors work here
- callback functions = create a function e.g. callbackrestrictQty which will be called when the form is transformed
