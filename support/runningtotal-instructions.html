Instructions for Running Total:

1) Copy the code example into a new web page e.g. mals.html
2) Download and save the mals-scripts.js file into the same folder (note: can be in another)
3) Change the product information in the form to your products

    <input name="qty1" type="text" placeholder="Enter Quantity" />
    <input type="hidden" name="product1" value="Product" />
    <input type="hidden" name="price1" value="10.00" />

    TIP!
    - Use <select name="qtyX"> instead of text input to make it easier for customer to order

4) Add the running total display

    Total: $<span id="malsRunningTotal">0.00</span>
        
    The script looks for element with id malsRunningTotal within form. If it isn't there it will append it to the end

5) Ensure your wwX and userid are the same as Mals (TIP! enter your details at the top before copying example)
6) Open the web page in a browser e.g. Chrome and test it

--- Calling Script ---
The script is very versatile. You can activate it on one or more forms (or links) easily. Note: if you don't know jQuery selectors visit https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_selectors.asp

- Example 1 = specific form by id
MalsScripts.runningTotal('#form1');

This will activate the script on the form with id="form1"
    
- Example 2 = cart delimiter. The script uses {br} as the cart delimiter which spaces the product in the cart. You can change this to whatever you wish
MalsScripts.runningTotal('#form1',',');
    
- Example 3 = submit callback function
MalsScripts.runningTotal('#form1','{br}',function(){
    // Called when form is submitted
    
});

- Example 4 = running total update callback
runningTotal(element,,function(){
    // Called when running total display is updated
    
})

- Example 5 = callback called when input element is clicked/updated
runningTotal(element,{br},,,function(){
    // Called when input element is changed
    
})

--- General Notes ---
- Add class .mals-ignore to any forms you don't want transformed e.g. <form action="http://wwX.aitsafe.com/cf/add.cfm" class="mals-ignore">...
- You can select multiple forms by using a comma e.g. MalsScripts.runningTotal('#form1,#form2');
- jQuery selectors work here
- callback functions = create a function e.g. callbackrunningTotal which will be called when the form is transformed
