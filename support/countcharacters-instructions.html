Instructions for Count Characters:

1) Copy the code example into a new web page e.g. mals.html
2) Download and save the mals-scripts.js file into the same folder (note: can be in another)
3) Change the product information in the form to your product
    e.g. <input type="hidden" name="product[]" value="Custom Item" />
4) Change the price value to your price
    e.g. <input type="hidden" name="price" value="20" />
5) For the input field you wish show characters remaining add maxlength="x"
    e.g. <input type="text" name="product[]" maxlength="20" />

    The script will automatically pick up the maxlength value and display remaining characters

    TIP!
    - Use a placeholder to make it obvious what to do
    e.g. <input type="text" name="product[]" maxlength="20" placeholder="Line 1: Add your necklace text here" />

5) Ensure your wwX and userid are the same as Mals (TIP! enter your details at the top before copying example)
6) Open the web page in a browser e.g. Chrome and test it

--- Calling Script ---
The script is very versatile. You can activate it on one or more forms (or links) easily. Note: if you don't know jQuery selectors visit https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_selectors.asp

- Example 1 = specific form by id
MalsScripts.countCharacters('#form1');

This will activate the script on the form with id="form1"
    
- Example 2 = specific forms by id
MalsScripts.countCharacters('#form1,#form2');

This will activate the script on two forms with id="form1" and id="form2"
    
- Example 3 = all forms by class
MalsScripts.countCharacters('.myform');

This will activate the script on all forms with class="myform"
    
- Example 4 = callback function
MalsScripts.countCharacters('#form1',function(element,charactersRemaining,event){
    // Called when input field is updated
    // can be used to create your own alert
    // Returns
    // - element = element object being changed
    // - charactersRemaining = number of characters remaining for selected element
    // - event = event object
});

--- General Notes ---
- Add class .mals-ignore to any forms you don't want transformed e.g. <form action="http://wwX.aitsafe.com/cf/add.cfm" class="mals-ignore">...
- You can select multiple forms by using a comma e.g. MalsScripts.countCharacters('#form1,#form2');
- jQuery selectors work here
- callback functions = create a function e.g. callbackcountCharacters which will be called when the form is transformed
