Instructions for Price Options:

1) Copy the code example into a new web page e.g. mals.html
2) Download and save the mals-scripts.js file into the same folder (note: can be in another)
3) Change the product information in the form to your product
    e.g. <input type="hidden" name="product" value="Curtains" />
4) Change the base price value
    e.g. <input type="hidden" name="price" value="20" />
5) Create your product options

    <select name="product[]">
        <option value="Small:0">Small</option>
        <option value="Medium:5.00">Medium (+$5)</option>
        <option value="Large:7.00">Large (+$7)</option>
    </select>

    Just like productpr the option values are divided into

    product:price

    TIP!
    - Include the product name in both value and text of option to make it clear to customer in cart too
6) Add the total display. Give it an id of malsRunningTotal

    Total: $<span id="malsRunningTotal">0.00</span>

6) Ensure your wwX and userid are the same as Mals (TIP! enter your details at the top before copying example)
7) Open the web page in a browser e.g. Chrome and test it

--- Calling Script ---
The script is very versatile. You can activate it on one or more forms (or links) easily. Note: if you don't know jQuery selectors visit https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_selectors.asp

- Example 1 = specific form by id
MalsScripts.priceOptions('#form1');

This will activate the script on the form with id="form1"
    
- Example 2 = cart delimiter. The script uses {br} as the cart delimiter which spaces the product in the cart. You can change this to whatever you wish
MalsScripts.priceOptions('#form1',',');
    
- Example 3 = submit callback function
MalsScripts.priceOptions('#form1','{br}',function(){
    // Called when form is submitted
    
});

- Example 4 = running total update callback
priceOptions(element,,function(){
    // Called when running total display is updated
    
})

- Example 5 = callback called when input element is clicked/updated
priceOptions(element,{br},,,function(){
    // Called when input element is changed
    
})

--- General Notes ---
- Add class .mals-ignore to any forms you don't want transformed e.g. <form action="http://wwX.aitsafe.com/cf/add.cfm" class="mals-ignore">...
- You can select multiple forms by using a comma e.g. MalsScripts.priceOptions('#form1,#form2');
- jQuery selectors work here
- callback functions = create a function e.g. callbackpriceOptions which will be called when the form is transformed
